# Hows the Weather?

[janisarja.github.io/hows-the-weather](https://janisarja.github.io/hows-the-weather)

This is a web app for checking the current weather information for a given location. The 
weather data is from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/). First you search by 
the name of a city you want to see the weather for. Then you choose the right city from the 
results below. Sometimes there are more than one places with the same name in different 
countries or states. The country code (and possible state) is indicated after the name of the 
location in the search results.

This web app was made with React. It uses axios for getting the weather data through an api.
